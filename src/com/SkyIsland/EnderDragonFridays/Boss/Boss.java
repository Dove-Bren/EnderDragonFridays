 * Represents a boss monster.<br />
 * Bosses are intended to be a class that works to manipulate in-game objects to
 * present players with a challenging boss fight.<br />
 * Bosses are <b>not</b> a decendent of {@link org.bukkit.entity.Entity Entity} and shouldn't
 * be thought of as such. Instead, a Boss envolopes all entities involved in the boss fight, all
 * components a boss fight will have (e.g. cannons in the case of EnderDragonFridays EnderDragons), AND
 * all data and methods related to the boss fight itself.
